Actual config file has auth token in it (scary!) so it is in .gitignore
Here is what the config.py should look like
guild = 0     guild id
channel = 0   channel id where you can only say 'fart club'
poo_clan = 0  role id of poo clan
general = 0   role id to let people talk in general
dbpath = ''   /path/to/your/sqlite/database.db
token = ''    auth token
